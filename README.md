## Project Description
Tipsy is a Web Application for users who want to learn the art of bartending. The user will be invited to a bar, and within the bars, there will be an example recipe of actual mixed drinks the user may learn from and recipes made by other users who were in the same bar. The users may be creative and make their own drinks, or further more, create their own bar. The web application should be able to provide the service of teaching the instructions on how to make common drinks we may see in real life.
### Overview
Have you ever wanted to learn the art of bartending? What are the various tools needed to create a good drink you could serve at a bar? Given the various forms of alcohol out there, we merge our creativity alongside it. The possibilities are endless. Tipsy is designed to teach you these skills! Users will be allowed to make their own bars, where they can then invite their friends to so they can attempt to recreate their own custom made recipes. This web application will serve as a simulator for creating various drinks of your own, or it can serve as a training tool for teaching aspiring bartenders how to create their own drinks. It teaches the ins and outs of creating your favorite alcoholic drinks right in the convenience of your own web browser.

### Progress Reports

# Build Process and Work Flow

### Team Procedures
Our team has utilized various tools to ensure that our progress continues at a steady rate. In regards to organization we used Trello and TeamGantt to properly delegate our work evenly. For staying connected we created a group chat in Facebook Messenger. For organizing meetings we used When2Meet to quickly find a time where all members were available to schedule an appropriate time to hold a meeting.

### Rules for committing
We as a group have collectively decided to only make commits once a significant amount of progress has been made and to be descriptive in each commit.
